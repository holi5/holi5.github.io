Narrowing down our list to just 10 scenes was a challenge, as there are so many iconic scenes from Sholay to choose from. The truth is, where thousands of movies have struggled to create one magical moment, almost every scene in Sholay is a contender, which is why it is still celebrated four decades after its release. 
From Sholay's important fight sequence, Darr's thrilling chase to Silsila's iconic Rang Barse, here's a look at 7 Holi scenes in Hindi films that became an important part of the plot. 
Sholay obliterated the records of South Indian movies in Hindi version. Now is it the best movie made in Bollywood, maybe not, but overall in almost every parameters it aces, impact, popularity, critical and commercial succes, you name it. Sholay might or might not the best movie of Bollywood, but it is definitely the Greatest 
From ‘Basanti, in Kutton ke saamne nahi nachna’ to ‘Kitne Aadmi they’, the dialogues from Sholay are some of the most popular ones in the history of Indian cinema. It has been almost 45 years since the release of this blockbuster from Ramesh Sippy but every character, scene and dialogue from Sholay remains timeless and evergreen.

Sholay means “embers” in Hindi. In this film, a police officer whose family was filled by a bandit named Gabbar Singh decides to fight fire with fire and requires two convicts, Jai and Veeru, to capture Gabbar. He approaches them in jail and puts the proposal in front of them, and they agree to bring in Gabbar Singh alive–for a hefty price.
