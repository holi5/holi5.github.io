        <p>And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us; 1 Corinthians 2:12 Verse Concepts Taught By The Spirit God Giving His Spirit Spiritual Gifts sonship Knowing About God's Kingdom Understanding God Giving Understanding 
The Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit and Paul links grace being with our spirit. Once again we see grace and the Holy Spirit closely linked together. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen (Gal 6:18) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. (Phm 1:25) 
That is the work of the Holy Spirit! To Conclude The abundant grace of Jesus Christ meets our needs by this overflowing grace, which also touches the lives of others. This is the abounding grace of God overflowing in our lives by the deep work of the Holy Spirit upon us and in us. The Holy Spirit and the grace of God are absolutely linked together. 
Role of the Holy Spirit in Grace The Holy Spirit is instrumental in the application of grace to believers. Through the Spirit, individuals are convicted of sin, drawn to repentance, and regenerated. In John 16:8, Jesus describes the work of the Holy Spirit: "And when He comes, He will convict the world in regard to sin and righteousness and  
The Holy Spirit, as the Spirit of Grace, plays a crucial role in the life of a believer. He is the agent of regeneration and sanctification, transforming the heart and mind to align with God's will. In John 14:16-17 , Jesus promises the coming of the Holy Spirit: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be with you  
In summary, the Spirit of Grace is a vital aspect of the Holy Spirit's ministry, encompassing the initiation, sustenance, and culmination of the believer's relationship with God. Through His gracious work, believers are drawn into a deeper understanding of God's love and are equipped to live out their faith in a manner that glorifies Him. 
The Holy Spirit is a divine helper, advisor, and friend who strengthens our faith and guides our steps when we seek God’s will. So let us take a moment to reflect on these verses and allow our hearts to be open to the wisdom and comfort the Holy Spirit offers us through prayer. Bible Verses About Praying to the Holy Spirit 
When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession—to the praise of his glory.” – Ephesians 1:13-14.

In Matthew 28:19, He instructs disciples to baptize “in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” The apostle Paul frequently references the Trinity.

The Bible teaches us that when we repent and believe in Christ as our savior, we receive the Holy Spirit within us. As the apostle Paul explained in Ephesians 1:13-14, “When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit, who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession — to the praise of his glory.”
