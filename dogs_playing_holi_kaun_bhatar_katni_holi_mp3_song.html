Don‚Äôt engage your dog in color play. Remember, what may be ‚Äòsafe and herbal‚Äô for you may still not be safe for your dogs. If absolutely necessary, use turmeric, kumkum, neem or henna powder, or beetroot juice as pet-friendly colors to play Holi with your furry friends. Keep water and moisture away from your pet‚Äôs skin &amp; coat.

Teach your children to play responsibly: Most of us have come across adults who throw colours at dogs and forcefully play with them. While adults are becoming aware, children may take pleasure in playing Holi with animals. Teach your children not to throw colours or splash water at animals as it can cause harm to them.

Though we are excited about the prospect of throwing colors on each other, pets and stray animals present outside detest getting hit with these balloons  
Some vets, I know have encountered abusive behaviour towards animals during holi. Stray animals are often targeted on purpose and visit the clinic with injuries post Holi. It is not only traumatic for a dog, but it can also exacerbate their anxiety. When water and colours are left on a pet's fur, the moisture might cause a fungal illness. 
Holi is a festival of colours and joy that is celebrated across India and other parts of the world. It is a time to come together with family and friends, play with colours, dance to music, and
