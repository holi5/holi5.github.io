        <p>The stage which marks the break and end if the old order and status before th eindividual or group come to terms with the new phase. What are some examples of Pre-Liminal phases? Before a Wedding. 
Anthropologist Victor Turner took van Gennep‚Äôs model and gave particular emphasis to the liminal rites, suggesting that after being separated from the society, but before being incorporated back into it, the person going through the rite of passage existed in a sort of ‚Äúbetwixt and between‚Äù state, a kind of limbo, where their identity was  
the entire process into three stages viz. Rites of Separation, Rites of Transitional Stage and Rites of Incorporation. In simpler terms these stages are now called as Pre-Liminal, Liminal and Post- Liminal Stages. He was more curious about the middle stage that is the liminal stage. Gennep 
These phases include pre-liminal which is ‚Äúrelated to separating from the previous life‚Äù, liminal which refers to ‚Äútransitioning from one stage to another‚Äù and finally post-liminal which is related to a ‚Äúnew status or state of life‚Äù (Peta Goldburg, 2009). 
The pre-liminal phase involves the separation, marginality, and insignificance, while the liminal phase encompasses the threshold, ambiguity, and communitas. The post-liminal phase consists of the incorporation, reintegration, and significance stages. These stages highlight the importance of transitions, personal growth, and social integration. 
Liminality is an anthropological term, first coined by van Gennep in his 1909 book Rites of Passage. The word is derived from the Latin limen, which means ‚Äòthreshold‚Äô. Liminality refers to the ambivalence, confusion, or disorientation experienced in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not [] 
preliminal rites (or rites of separation): This stage involves a metaphorical ‚Äúdeath‚Äù, as the initiand is forced to leave something behind by breaking with previous practices and routines. liminal rites (or transition rites): This involves ‚Äúthe creation of a tabula rasa, through the removal of previously taken-for-granted forms and limits  
Ritual analysis that focuses very much on structure. The three common stages in all rituals include: Pre-Liminal, Liminal and Post-Liminal 
Specifically, this study examines the interaction between the pre-liminal and liminal stages. Through a longitudinal and multi-sited approach, incorporating visual anthropology and participant interviews at rock music festivals, we demonstrate that consumers can undergo three types of liminality‚Äîunbridled, oriented, and restrained liminality  
coined the word liminal, defining it as a time when a person's social status changes within a ritual framework2. Gennep discovered that rituals in diverse cultures worldwide may be divided into three stages: pre-liminal (before) and post-liminal (after), with the liminal condition positioned in the centre when shown on a timeline (10-11:1960)3  
The word liminal is from the Latin ‚Äòlimen‚Äô, which means ‚Äòthreshold‚Äô, and is used to describe the second stage of the ritual where the person‚Äôs status is somehow changed or transformed. Van Gennep used the term ‚Äòliminality‚Äô to describe the state in which people are on the threshold of entering a new phase in their life, who have  
The present study has focused on the early life of Swami Vivekananda where the incidents of his earlier life are connected to pre liminal stage. His transformation from doubtfulness to clarification, apprehensions to trust and unsteadiness to surrender are discussed through a few incidents in his life which indicate the stage of pre liminal.

The findings are presented within the three liminal transition stages: i) a pre-liminal state of separation and detachment, ii) a liminal state of instability, ambiguity and prolonged liminality and iii) a post-liminal state of stability and completeness. 
6. The whole liminal period is freighted with sacredness and holiness, the transcendent. Turner‚Äôs key contribution to the theory of liminality is then to juxtapose the structure of the pre- and post-liminal phases with the anti-structure of the liminal. Structure and anti-structure have 3. 
A Liminality Primer. by. Timothy Carson. At the entre¬¥ of the Twentieth Century anthropologist Arnold van Gennep was drawn to the broad patterns of regeneration he observed within communal systems, an array of cultural transitions mediated by rites and rituals. 
THE PRE-LIMINAL STAGE OF NINA Nina is in the pre-liminal stage, her first stage of her rites of passage. In this stage, Nina withdraws from her current status and prepares to move from childhood to adulthood with the involvement of symbolic behavior signifying the detachment from an earlier fixed point in the social structure (Turner, 1969, p.80). 
stages/phases: pre liminal (separation), liminal (transition) and post liminal (incorporation). The pre liminal or the separation phase, according to Gennep, is when partakers (the initiates) consciously detach from old status, identity, environment, etc., focusing on the fact that a new status, identity, environment will soon be assumed.
