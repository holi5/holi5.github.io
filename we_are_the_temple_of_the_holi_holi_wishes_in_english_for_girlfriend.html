        <p>What agreement can exist between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.” Ephesians 2:21-22 In Him the whole building is fitted together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 
19 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; ( B ) 20 you were bought at a price. ( C ) Therefore honor God with your bodies. 
The church of Jesus Christ is a spiritual temple made of “living stones. . . being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ” (1 Peter 2:5). Not only is the church as a whole or as the local body the dwelling place of God’s presence, but individual believers  
Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is  
For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be My people.” John 14:17 
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the corner stone, in whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, read more. 
For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple. Read full chapter. Footnotes. 3:16 Or among. 1 Corinthians 2. 1 Corinthians 4. New Living Translation (NLT) 
THE CHRISTIAN IS A TEMPLE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT! 1 Cor. 6:19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? This is the next aspect of this truth that we should notice. Not only is the church the Temple of God, but the Christian is a Temple of the Holy Spirit! 
As temples of the living God, we should be holy in everything we do, just as God is holy (1 Peter 1:15–16). In the same way the Jerusalem temple unified the people of Israel, the metaphorical New Testament temple is designed to unite believers in one harmonious community. 
Yet when we read the Bible, we see that God instructed the Jewish people to build a temple—a special place where they could go to hear from God and experience his presence. Today we go to church for a similar reason. Or we might go into the mountains or visit the sea-shore to experience God’s presence in the midst of his creation. 
The word for "Temple" here is naos which refers to the Sanctuary of the Temple area, including the Holy Place and the "inner sanctum" or place where God dwells (i.e., the "Holy of Holies"). The Sanhedrin later used Yeshua's words about destroying the Temple as a capital charge against Him at His trial (Matt. 26:61; Mark 14:58; cf. Matt. 27:40  
And so we are holy. And so he calls on us to be holy because we are God’s temple. The essence of holiness in this sense, is purity from evil. God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all, 1 John 15. And so it should be for us. Be holy, because, I, the Lord, your God, am holy, as we heard last week from Bryan Young, beautiful. 
We, as the temple of the Holy Spirit, are called to live holy lives that reflect God’s presence within us. As we build our lives upon the foundation of Christ, we are continually being transformed into a holy temple, a dwelling place for God’s Spirit, where His glory can shine for the world to see.

So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. 
Since we as believers are God’s holy temple, both individually and corporately, Paul draws an important conclusion: “If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.” (1 Corinthians 3:17) 
1. Great buildings, great temple? Last year there was a competition held to decide the ‘new 7 wonders of the world’? The results were announced on 7.7.07. And the winners were, not in any particular order – the statue of Christ the Redeemer in Brasil; and ironically the Colosseum in Rome where so many

The concept of the "Temple of the Holy Spirit" is a profound theological truth found within the New Testament, primarily articulated by the Apostle Paul. This concept underscores the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit within believers, signifying a transformative relationship between God and His people. 
You Are the Temple of the Holy Spirit OUR VISION is to take the Gospel both to our nearby world and to the ends of the earth, proclaiming Christ, and warning and teaching every man with all wisdom, in order that we may present every person fully mature in Christ Jesus. 
20 And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone; 21 In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: </p>
