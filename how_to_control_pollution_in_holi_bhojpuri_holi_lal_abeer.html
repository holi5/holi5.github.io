From water pollution to waste generation, the environmental footprint of Holi can be significant. In this article, we explore the environmental implications of Holi and discuss ways to mitigate its impact on the planet. Water Pollution . One of the most significant environmental concerns associated with Holi is water pollution. 
One of the most significant contributors to environmental pollution during Holi is the widespread use of synthetic colors.
