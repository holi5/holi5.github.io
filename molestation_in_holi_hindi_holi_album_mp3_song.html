        <h2><strong>molestation in holi new holi dj song 2025 release</strong></h2>
        <p>The celebration of Holi in India is often marred by incidents of molestation and harassment as the phrase ‚ÄúBura na mano Holi Hai‚Äù (Don‚Äôt feel bad, it is Holi) is used to justify all such criminal acts where more often than not, women become the target. Several incidents of violence, molestation, harassment of minorities and women 
Its jubilance is crystalized in the popular Hindi catchphrase: "Bura Na Mano, Holi Hai," which loosely translates to, "Don't feel bad, it's Holi." Let's unpack what this means: in theory, non-stop party ‚Äî a coming together of friends and foes, where all grievances are forgiven ‚Äî marked by great food, music and flowing drinks. 
Several incidents of violence, molestation, harassment of minorities and women surfaced on social media between March 7 and 8 when Holi was celebrated across different parts of the country. It was reported that Delhi‚Äôs Police Control Room received over 35,000 complaints on Holi while on an average they receive 24,000 complaints daily. 
During the recent Holi festival celebrated by the Hindu majority in India, incidents of violence and hate crimes against the Muslim community surged.Several Indian states, including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Telangana, saw numerous cases of molestation and harassment targeting Muslims, especially women, by Hindu groups between March 23 and 25. 
A key phrase reiterated by Holi revellers, ingrained in popular culture, is ‚ÄúBura Na Mano, Holi Hai‚Äù (Don‚Äôt mind, it‚Äôs Holi). But it can serve as carte blanche for some men to abuse others. 
New Delhi: The Japanese woman who was reportedly groped in Delhi on the occasion of Holi, according to a viral video, tweeted on Friday that she had arrived in Bangladesh and was unaware of the serious situation in India until Delhi Police took notice of the video."I am fine in mind and body. I will explain more tomorrow," the lady tweeted in  
Holi -- the festival of colours -- was never a festival meant for women in India. Even today, we hear numerous cases of a physical and sexual harassment in the name of the festival. 
Amrita is another victim of child sexual abuse during Holi had to face similar issues, she said, 'I was a victim of sexual harassment as a kid on Holi, was vocal about it and still did not receive  
New Delhi: A video of a Japanese woman being allegedly manhandled while playing Holi in India went viral on the internet earlier this week.As the video sparked a row, Delhi Police sprung into action, filed an FIR and arrested three persons including a juvenile in connection with the harassment and molestation of the Japanese woman. 
After a video of a Japanese woman being groped and harassed by a group of men in Delhi during Holi celebrations emerged, Delhi Police said they have written to the Japanese embassy requesting help in establishing her identity. The Japanese embassy was contacted and they said they don't have any information about any such incident, the DCP told PTI.

That didn't seem to invalidate their 'molestation.' Also, 'consent' isn't determined based on your victim's 'reaction' to your advances. The whole point of consent is to seek 'before' you make the advances. 
03/10/2020 March 10, 2020. Holi, a spring festival that marks the end of winter is celebrated with bright colors and water. But for many women, the day has a darker side.

Saeed Akhtar Issraeli, a social worker in Sambhal, promotes peace between communities by distributing festive gifts during Holi and Jumma in Ramzan. He emphasizes the importance of Hindu-Muslim unity, encouraging a peaceful celebration of both cultural and religious events across India. 
So yes, the average Indian experiences sexual harassment often enough for it to be a widespread cultural issue. I don‚Äôt know a single woman who hasn‚Äôt experienced some kind of sexual abuse or violence and a fair percentage of men have experienced it too. We also don‚Äôt count marital rape- which would increase the numbers by several fold. 
Moreover, I don't think molestation during Holi is so common like you or the OP is making it look like. If you are going by the social media videos and posts, some are real molestation and the person involved must be jailed, but many aren't and do note that if you do not record when the ladies are applying colour to men, and record it when men  
After a video of a Japanese woman being groped and harassed by a group of men in Delhi during Holi celebrations emerged, Delhi Police said they have written  
Molestation in the name of celebration. #Holi 
The name Holi comes from the legend behind the holiday in which the demoness Holika was sent by King Kiranyakashipu to kill his son Prahlada. Holika tried to trick Prahlada into burning to death on a pyre, but because her intentions were evil, she was the one who was burned and killed. Now we know why Holi exists, but where does the color fight  </p>
