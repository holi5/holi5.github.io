Forget the body &amp; hair, even the house, lawns, roads everything was dirty. Holi ended up being more of a messy celebration than a happy one and i therefore stopped enjoying it and thereby celebrating it. Unlike Diwali, for me personally Holi doesn't hold a strong nostalgic connection or even a cultural connection except the Holi songs .

Celebrations for the Holi Spring festival are set to begin on March 18. After being affected by COVID-19 shutdowns for the past two years, this year Holi is expected to be back in a big way. However, with Holi associated with an increase in road crashes and fatalities in India, it‚Äôs important to take steps to put safety first. 
Only a small part of our population celebrates Holi in large masses. Only some people attend a holi party. Holi is a festival you would celebrate with your friends and family. I'm 27 and I've never touched a stranger neither any stranger touched me (male or female) in my entire life while playing holi because everyone plays it with their own group. 
Courtesy his experience on Top Gear and The Grand Tour, May is somewhat of an expert on driving. And this is a subject that involves a lot of chaos on Indian roads. Remarking on the driving in India, James May says, ‚ÄúI have always maintained that the system of driving in India works very well. It doesn‚Äôt move very quickly but it does.

There are literally 100s of videos posted on Twitter about the harassment during the Holi celebration. The moment you raise your voice, braindead people start whataboutery and start bringing other religions malicious practices to hide theirs, They have become so rotten that they have started defending it and asking women to stay inside as people are drunk and enjoying Holi.

So a for profit event that isn't as inclusive as Holi was allowed to take place under the pretence of "Charity" while claiming it got its paint and powder throwing ideas from a spanish tomato throwing festival despite every single picture looking like Holi while actively preventing people from enjoying Holi. That is Cultural Appropriation. </p>
