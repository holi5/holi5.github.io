Holi is a popular ancient Hindu festival, originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is celebrated predominantly in India and Nepal, but has also spread to other areas of Asia and parts of the Western world through the diaspora from the Indian subcontinent. Holi is popularly known as the Indian &amp;quot;festival of spring&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;festival of colours&amp;quot;, or the &amp;quot;festival of love  
A BJP MLA in Bihar on Monday made an “appeal" to Muslims to “stay indoors" on Holi, which this year falls on a Friday during the holy month of Ramazan, and to “let Hindus celebrate their festival" without any disruptions. Haribhushan Thakur Bachaul, the MLA from Bisfi assembly constituency in

Stirring controversy he said, “In a year, there are 52 Fridays. One Friday is on the same day as Holi. I am appealing to Muslims that they should let Hindus celebrate Holi and not be offended if colours are thrown at them. If they have a problem with this, they should rather stay at home.” 
A BJP MLA in Bihar triggered controversy on Monday by asking Muslims to “stay indoors” on Holi festival instead of coming out to pray on a Ramzan Friday, if they wanted to keep away from colours. The statement caused a furore with the Opposition slamming the saffron party and also lambasting  
Thousands of people, including Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and Sikhs, congregated to celebrate Holi on the white campus of the Dewa Sharif shrine, which turned yellow, green, and pink.

BJP leader Raghuraj Singh's remarks on Muslim men wearing tarpaulin hijabs during Holi have sparked controversy. Singh suggested this to avoid inconvenience as Holi coincides with Friday prayers in Ramzan. Uttar Pradesh's administration is on alert, with some mosques shifting prayer timings.
