Holi is a 1984 Indian coming of age drama film directed by Ketan Mehta, whose socially conscious work has been compared to American director Spike Lee. It is based on eponymous play by Marathi writer, Mahesh Elkunchwar. 
HOLI is about a group of restless, directionless and disillusioned youngsters on the campus, who finally vent their frustrations on a gullible victim, ending in a gruesome tragedy. No upcoming shows. 
Vijaya Mehta directed both Sultan and Holi, also published in Satyakatha in 1969, for Rangayan in 1970. Elkunchwar wrote eight one-act plays over the next five years, presenting a wide range of dramatic situations, theatrical devices, and speech rhythms. 
This experience deeply influenced him, and he decided to become a playwright after watching the play twice and dedicating a year to reading plays of all kinds. Until his retirement as Head in 1999, Mahesh Elkunchwar taught English literature at Dharampeth Arts, Commerce College, and M.P. Deo Memorial Science College, both located in Nagpur.
