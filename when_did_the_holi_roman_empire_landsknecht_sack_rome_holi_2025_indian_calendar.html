        <p>The Sack of Rome, then part of the Papal States, followed the capture of Rome on 6 May 1527 by the mutinous troops of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, during the War of the League of Cognac. Charles V only intended to threaten military action to make Pope Clement VII come to his terms. 
Sack of Rome, an attack on the city of Rome on May 6, 1527, by the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, Charles V. Charles’s victory over the French at Pavia in 1525 had left his armies dominant in Italy . 
The 34,000 Imperial troops mutinied and forced their commander, Charles III, Duke of Bourbon, to lead them towards Rome. The Sack of Rome in 1527 was executed by some 6,000 Spaniards under the Duke, 14,000 Landsknechte under Georg von Frundsberg, some Italian infantry and some cavalry. 
Soon after the sack, Pope Clement VII and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, publicly reconciled when the emperor met the pope in Bologna, where the emperor was crowned by the pope in 1530. Although the traditional coronation ceremony long emphasized papal authority over the Empire, this time the ritual belied Charles V’s domination of Italian  
The Landsknechts were pike-and-shot mercenaries that formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire’s army, and had a reputation for being brave, elite soldiers at the time. The army remained dominant in Italy, but when funds dried up, the thousands of Landsknecht mercenaries that made up a majority of the army mutinied. The mutineers decided if  
The Holy Roman Empire, [e] also known as the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation after 1512, was a polity in Central and Western Europe, usually headed by the Holy Roman Emperor. [16] It developed in the Early Middle Ages , and lasted for a millennium until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars . 
Unlike the Visigothic sack, which had been brief and controlled, the Vandals’ methodical looting exacerbated Rome’s decline. The Western Roman Empire, already on its last legs, lacked the resources and political cohesion to recover from this blow. For Genseric and his people, the sack of Rome solidified their power and prestige. 
How did the Sack of Rome impact the city’s population? Rome’s population plummeted from 54,000 to around 11,000 due to killings, famine, disease, and mass exodus, leaving the city in economic and cultural ruin. What was the long-term effect on the Papacy? The Pope lost significant power, forcing him into submission to Charles V. 
Mutinous army of Holy Roman Empire laid waste to city Imperial forces attack Rome An army loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, laid siege to the city of Rome on this day in 1527, at the start of the Sack of Rome, a significant event in the conflict between Charles and the so-called League of Cognac that had profound implications for Rome  
Sack of Rome. An assault on the city of Rome that occurred on May 6, 1527, by the armies of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor. The popes and emperors had been contending for power in the Italian peninsula for centuries, with the other major powers of the continent taking sides in the conflict to advance their own interests. 
The Landsknechte were Germanic mercenaries used in pike and shot formations during the early modern period. Their front line was formed by pikemen and supporting foot soldiers. The Landsknechte formed the bulk of the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Army from the late 1400s to the early 1600s, fighting in numerous wars. Although prone to mutiny, they were well-armed and fierce warriors  
The Sack of Rome in 1527 was of critical importance in the history of Italy. It guaranteed Spanish supremacy in Italy, led to increasingly religious orthodoxy, and destroyed Rome's economy. It was not the Sack itself, but the effects of the Sack that contributed to the ending of the Renaissance. Why did the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V's army  
The Sack of Rome was a terrible story, caused by the conflict, for domination over Europe, between Charles V, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and Francis I of Valois, King of France. The troops of Charles V amounted to about 40 000 men, including 14,000 Landsknecht, they penetrated in Rome with great losses.

Father of the Landsknecht. One of the most famous landsknecht commanders was Georg von Frundsberg [1473-1528] whose motto, viel feind, viel ehre, meant “many enemies, much honour.” Frundsberg masterminded most of Maximilian’s early victories and continued to serve the Holy Roman Empire under his successor Charles V. 
The Sack of Rome in 410 AD: The Fall of an Empire and the Rise of Medieval Europe. The Sack of Rome in 410 AD by the Visigoths, led by King Alaric, remains one of the most symbolic and devastating events in the history of the Roman Empire. For centuries, Rome had stood as the pinnacle of power, wealth, and culture. 
To understand the significance of the Sack of Rome, it is important to consider the historical context of the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries AD. By this time, the Empire had been divided into two halves: the Western Roman Empire, centered in Rome and later Ravenna, and the Eastern Roman Empire, centered in Constantinople.
