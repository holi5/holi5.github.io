        <p>Its difficult to know, of course, whether this was the same as modern Holi and the first unequivical mention of Holi only comes from the 7th century Sanskrit drama ‘Ratnavali.’ Meanwhile, images of the Holika story precede images of the actual festival by a good five hundred years. 
The Mughal rulers also celebrated this festival enthusiastically in their era. Holi was celebrated as Id-i-Gulabi during the reigns of Mughal emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. In Mughal India, it was also known as Aab-iPashi (shower colourful flowers). 
According to former regional director of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and Padma Shri recipient KK Muhammed, Holi was celebrated like Eid at Agra Fort and Red Fort in Delhi during the Mughal era. "It was called Eid- e- Gulabi (Pink Eid) or Aab-e-Pashi (shower of colourful flowers)," he said. 
The Mughal rulers gave state recognition to the Holi festival. In those times, Holi celebrations stretched over many days in the Mughal court. Amir Umrao also used to participate in Holi with the general public of the state.

In Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri, Emperor Jahangir recounts his active participation in Holi celebrations and the organisation of gatherings known as ‘Mehfil-e-Holi’. Numerous paintings depict Jahangir playing Holi with his wife Noor Jahan, created by artists like Govardhan and Rasik. 
Holi has been an integral part of Islam for centuries. Holi was celebrated as Id-e-Gulabi during the reign of Mughal emperors like Shahjahan and Akbar. In Mughal India, it was also called “Aab-e-Pashi” (shower of colourful flowers). 
The Mughal Indian emperor Jahangir celebrating Holi with ladies of the zenana. The festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Sikhs, Jains [2] and Newars . [3] In Mughal India, Holi was celebrated with such exuberance that people of all castes could throw colour on the Emperor. [52] 
Holi, the festival of colours, will take place on March 14, this one of India’s most vibrant and joyous celebrations, marking the arrival of spring, renewal, and the triumph of good over evil.
