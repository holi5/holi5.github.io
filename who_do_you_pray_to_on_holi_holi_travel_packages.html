Just a day before Holi, we celebrate choti Holi, also called Holika Dahan. This is the day that marks the victory of good over evil. This year choti Holi will be observed on March 13. There's a mythological story, tale of Prahlad and Holika, that beautifully explains how good always wins over the evil. Let's deep dive into their story to  
Holi is called as Kamuni Punnami/Kama Purnima or Jajiri in Telugu. Hindus celebrate Holi as it relates to the legend of Kamadeva. Holi is also known by different names: Kamavilas, Kamuni Panduga and Kama-Dahanam. [93] It is a 10-day festival in Telangana, of which last two days are of great importance.

Holi will be celebrated on March 13 (holika dahan) and March 14 (appearance day of Shree Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). On the night of Holi is a full moon, a night to do a secret sadhana (prayer) to  
The Bible allows for prayer to one or all three, because all three are one. To the Father we pray with the psalmist, “Listen to my cry for help, my King and my God, for to you I pray” (Psalm 5:2). To the Lord Jesus, we pray as to the Father because they are equal. Prayer to one member of the Trinity is prayer to all. 
There is some confusion among believers as to whom we are supposed to address our prayers. The Bible says we are to pray to God the Father, through God the Son, by means of God the Holy Spirit. The Father Jesus taught that we are to pray to God the Father. O This, then, is how you should pray: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name  
Steven – I respect your disagreement and welcome open sharing of beliefs here. I believe you’re referring to Psalm 65:2, where God is referred to as “You who answer prayer, to you all people will come.” I do believe that God listens to our prayers and most often pray directly to Him myself. 
Prayers to Jesus are found in various forms, from the personal, heartfelt prayers of individuals to liturgical prayers like the “Agnus Dei” (Lamb of God) and “Anima Christi” (Soul of Christ). Catholics believe in the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, and many prayers are directed to Him during Holy Communion. 
“And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, who will never leave you. He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn’t looking for him and doesn’t recognize him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you.” John 14:16-17 
The best thing for us to do is simply to allow ourselves be drawn in by the Spirit. Letting go Dancing is a question of ‘letting go’ and my advice to you in your prayer to Father, Son or Spirit is to do just that. Pray to whoever you feel drawn at any given moment. The three persons of the Trinity are not jealous of each other. 
In fact, we are commanded to pray in Jesus’ name or authority. Jesus made this clear to His disciples on the night that He was betrayed. He said. In that day you will no longer ask me anything. I tell you the truth, my Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. Until now you have not asked for anything in my name. 
Direct Prayer to God. The Bible has clearly shown us that we can address God directly in prayer. Jesus Himself taught this in the Lord’s Prayer: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name” (Matthew 6:9). This prayer is directed directly towards God and emphasizes the relationship Christians should have with God. 
Jesus said in John 14:14, “If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.” Therefore, it would seem safe to say that we can pray to Jesus and ask Him to answer our prayers. Also, we can see further confirmation of this by looking at the phrase, “call upon the name of the Lord.” 
Our prayer is ultimately addressed to our Triune God, whichever aspects of His character we choose to focus on in the way we address Him during our prayers. What we should not do is pray to a mysterious, unknown god, or to a higher power of some sort, or to supposed saints, or to angels. Our prayers should be directed to none other than God alone. </p>
