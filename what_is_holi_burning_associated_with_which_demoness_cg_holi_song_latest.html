Once upon a time, there was a demon king named Hiranyakashipu. He was very powerful and wanted everyone to worship him instead of the gods. But his son, Prahlad, was different. 
Holika Dahan, also known as Chhoti Holi, is celebrated on the night before the main day of Holi. The ritual involves the lighting of a bonfire, where people gather together to perform puja, offer prayers, and seek blessings.
