One origin story for Holi’s particular color-throwing festivities comes from a legend in which a young Krishna would often ask his foster mother, Yashoda, why he was dark—Krishna and Vishnu are usually depicted as blue, and Krishna is called by the epithet Shyam (“Dark”)—while his beloved Radha’s skin was fair.

The origin of the festival is traced in Hindu mythology legends, one of which tells the story of a female demon, Holika, and her brother, King Hiranyakashipu.  Holi is a public holiday in India  
Contrary to popular belief, Holi was not just celebrated by Hindus in the medeival period. It also flourished in the courts of the Sultans and Mughals, and in the 13th century, the poet and inventor of Qawwali Amir Khusrau writes: kheluungii holi, Khaaja ghar aaye, dhan dhan bhaag hamare sajni, Khaaja aaye aangan mere
