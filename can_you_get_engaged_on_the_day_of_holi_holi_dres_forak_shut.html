        <p>Holika Dahan, also known as Choti Holi, is a significant event marked on the Chaturdashi date of Shukla Paksha of Phalgun month, falling this year on 24 March 2024, with Holi celebrated on the subsequent day, 25 March 2024. 
In the Hindu religion, celebrating Holika Dahan before Holi, the festival of colours, has great religious and spiritual significance. On the day of Holika Dahan, women prepare some delectable dishes which is offered to Holika in the evening and worshipped with faith and all the rituals and take the blessings of the elders. 
In 2025, the time after mid-May might bring a lot of success in marriage. If you are planning to get engaged or married in 2025, then this year can turn out to be good for both. On the other hand, for people who want to do love marriages, this year will prove very fruitful. The natives will feel very happy in such a situation. 
Marriage held during inauspicious Lagna might result in loss of employment, adulterous and Kulta wife, unable to conceive more than one child and unstable married life. We don't consider Lagna or ascendant while publishing Vivah Muhurat. However our Muhurat window of at least four hours should be sufficient enough to find the auspicious Lagna. 
However, the rules of Holi and Holika Dahan are very strict for the newly married pair. They need to be aware of negative energies and stay away from evil eyes. So if you are a newlywed couple, make sure you follow these do’s and don’ts on your first Holi together. Do’s and Don’ts on First Holi First Holi At Girl’s Maternal House

Therefore, set your calendars, get ready with your colors, and get ready to soak up the celebration — Holi is near! 
Holashtak, an eight-day period before Holi, starts on March 7, 2025, and ends on March 13, 2025. This time is deemed inauspicious for starting new ventures but is ideal for spiritual activities  
Holasthak is an 8-day period that occurs before Holi every year. This period is considered to be auspicious in many regions of India. However, the word Holashtak has been derived from two different words. “Hol means Holi”, the festival of colours and “Ashtak means Eight”. Holasthak Date and Timing Holasthak starts on: 7th March 2025 
Holi is celebrated at the end of the Hindu month of Phalguna. The first day, called Chhoti Holi or Holika Dahan, is when people light a bonfire to remember the victory over the demoness Holika. This will happen on March 13, 2025 (Thursday). The second day, known as Rangwali Holi, Dhulandi, or Phagwah, is when people celebrate by playing with  
This year, many could be celebrating the festival with their spouses for the very first time. A renowned astrologer educates on remedies that you and your spouse can follow on this auspicious occasion, to have a happy and prosperous married life. Holi is a festival which celebrates the victory of good over evil.

The Story of Holi Festival. The festival of Holi is celebrated on the day after the full moon in early March every year. It is also known as the Festival of Colors. Holi celebrates spring  
Did you get engaged over the holidays? No matter how big or small your wedding will be, you can #DIY your wedding decorations with items like mason jars from Goodwill  
Most courthouses require appointments to get licenses and get married there. However, in some instances, you can walk in and get it done. It’s best to call ahead in order not to waste your time. Where is the most accessible place to get married on the same day? Want to put a rush on it? Many states can accommodate you quickly. 
Don't use tret on the day prior, day of playing and at least a day afterwards. As another comment suggested prep your skin properly. I find using a lightweight oil like hemp seed or squalane helps too avoid skin irritation. Thoroughly cleanse afterwards with an oil based cleanser and do soothing skincare post playing. You should be fine. 
The Festival of Colour. To this day, on the eve of Holi, bonfires are lit across India in a ritual called Holika Dahan, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil, devotion over tyranny, and perhaps, a reminder that no power—divine or human—can hold absolute sway forever. 
The day before Holi is known as Choti Holi when Holika Dahan takes place. This time Chhoti Holi will be celebrated on 24th March. It is believed that if one worships with true devotion on this day, then they can get auspicious results in their lives. </p>
