        <p>Water (Hindi: जल, romanized: Jal) is a 2005 drama film written and directed by Deepa Mehta, with screenplay by Anurag Kashyap. It is set in 1938 and explores the lives of widows at an ashram in India. 
In Water, Mehta doesn’t beautify the brutality of the widows  or the eruption of Holi revelry in the ashram).  What Deepa Mehta has to say about the plight of women in India 60 years ago

Water DEEPA MEHTA (2005) A widow should be long suffering until death, self-restrained and chaste. A virtuous wife who remains chaste when her husband has died goes to heaven. A woman who is unfaithful to her husband is reborn in the womb of a jackal. - The Laws of Manu, Chapter 5 verse 156-161, Dharamshastras (Sacred Hind texts) 
In the movie "Water" by Deepa Mehta, the festival of color, known as Holi, plays a significant and symbolic role in adding depth to the narrative . Holi, the festival of colors, traditionally represents the arrival of spring, the victory of good over evil, and the breaking down of social barriers. 
MOVIE – WATER. BASIC DETAILS. The Movie Water is directed and produced by Deepa Mehta and was released after a long protest from Hindu Chauvinists, in the year 2007.

Deepa Mehta’s Water remains one of the most powerful films ever made, tackling the haunting reality of abandoned widows in India. Reflecting on the film’s journey, Mehta shared, “Wherever and whenever I’ve shown the film, the response has been pretty much the same. People have wept and stood frozen for at least fifteen minutes.” 
But her experience led her to write the script for “Water,” which she set in the late 1930s, when the practice of child marriage was still prevalent and Gandhi was mounting his challenges against such traditional practices. By 2000, Mehta said, she was ready to make the film after getting the script vetted by the proper authorities.

-Deepa Mehta. Deepa Mehta is an Indo – Canadian filmmaker best known for her ‘Elements Trilogy’, ‘Fire’, ‘Earth’ and ‘Water’. The storyline of Fire (1996) revolves around the life of two married women ignored and snubbed by their husbands who fall in love with each other.
