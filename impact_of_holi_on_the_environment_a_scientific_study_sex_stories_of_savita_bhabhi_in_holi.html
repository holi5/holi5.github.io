A recent study conducted under the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan revealed that chemical colors have all but wiped out India’s wonderful vegetable dyes [8].

Holi and methods of preparation of natural &amp; eco-friendly colors and de-pollute Holi and make it in sync with nature. Key words: Holi, Chemical colors, Natural colors, Eco-friendly _____ INTRODUCTION Holi is a religious spring festival celebrated by Hindus. It is primarily observed in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, 
This study was taken up with an initiative to determine the extent of effects that the ‘Holi’ colors have on water and soil, respectively. The bacteria inhabiting these contaminated water and soil samples were isolated for biochemical analyses. Their ability to degrade these dyes was determined after optimization studies. 
In this article, we explore the environmental impact of Holi celebrations and advocate for the adoption of eco-friendly practices to preserve our planet while reveling in the spirit of this vibrant festival. Environmental Impact of Holi. Holi, the festival of colors, is a vibrant and joyous occasion celebrated by millions across the globe. 
The study concluded that to increase the production and use of eco holi colours for the environmental safety, large-scale public awareness programmes on environmental and health hazards due to  
celebrations influence the environmental resources. Impact of festivals on environment Excess use of environmental resources and contamination provide the bad health of the resources. Therefore, pollution level for air, water, soil or sound is increasing gradually and as a result several consequences of health hazard are happening.[8] 
This study showed the microbiological impact of toxic colors used during ‘Holi’. Soil and water samples containing dye-degrading bacteria were isolated and screened for bioremediation purposes. The physic-chemical properties were studied extensively where the average temperature and pH of the water samples taken from all 3 sites were 21.7
