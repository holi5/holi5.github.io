        <p>The tradition of Holi at the Banke Bihari Temple is also really interesting. It is believed that on the day of Holi, the almighty only sits and observes his devotees play Holi and himself does not participate in the festivities. So it's actually the day before the main Holi festival, that the temple comes alive when God himself actually plays  
Well let me try to understand. The Holi festival is on 23rd, and that's the day when an effigy of Holi (it was a woman who tried to kill a God) is burnt on the streets in the night. The Holi is played the day after the Holi (or Holika as she is often known) is burnt. So the BIG celebration of colors will take on 24th. 
Huranga or Holi at Dauji Temple is one the last prominent Holi celebrations around Mathura and its possibly one of the most fun one as well. A day after Holi in Mathura all hell brakes loose in a small and sleepy town called Baldeo - women beat and strip the men and then throw around their clothes.

Lathmar Holi at Barsana and Nandgaon Holi doesnâ€™t really need an introduction anymore. The festival of colors, celebrated to mark the transition of seasons from Winter to Spring, is now played around the world. However, in villages near Mathura - namely Barsana and Nandgaon - it is played in its own unique way, a week before the actual Holi.

Here are some interesting facts about Holi food. 1. The tradition of consuming bhang during Holi dates back to ancient Hindu texts, where Lord Shiva is said to have consumed the cannabis plant during the festival. This the famous holi food. 2.

Holi celebrations at Mathura's Dwarkadhish Temple is a completely unique and once in a lifetime experience. Read more for some phenomenal pictures! 
About ten vehicles especially decorated for Holi participate in this procession which starts at the Vishram Ghat and continues beyond Holi Gate. The event roughly starts at about 3pm and goes on till sunset. The vehicles not just have people in them, they are also like a moving story. 
Well, for me it's two things - the views from there as well as the people. Before the pandemic I used to go there quite often for festivals like Gudi Padva, Holi etc and I was always welcomed with open arms. The folks living there really know how to celebrate festivals and how to also include outsiders and make them a part of their family.

Kumbh Mela 2015 at Nashik (Nasik) is about to get over and with it one of the world's largest gathering of humankind will come to an end. Unfortunately, I missed going to Kumbh at Nashik due to work commitments, but I followed many fantastic photographers and their work as they captured the essence of Kumbh though their lens. 
I spent Holi at Mathura-Vrindavan this year, and had the time of my life there. Almost on a whim, I also shot quite a bit of footage using iPhone 6. Once back, compiled it in to a short Holi video, the first in the series. Many more coming soon :) If you like the video, do not forget to SUBSCRIBE to my Travel Channel :) 
In Varanasi, beating the heat finds its most spirited expression during Holi. As temperatures rise, locals and visitors alike converge in the ancient streets, drenched in vibrant hues. The festival becomes a jubilant affair, with water balloons, colored powders, and joyous shouts filling the air, offering respite from the scorching sun in the  
Zanzari falls are located about two hours away on a bike from Ahmedabad and are wonderful weekend getaway with friends from the city. Everyone has friends of all types (unfortunately am reminded of the latest excessively aired Airtel ad), and one survives through life with them, their support and blah blah. </p>
