        <p>Zoya ran away from there and Asad followed her. Finally Asad caught her and applied colour on her cheeks. "Happy holi Mrs. Khan" he wished her. "Happy holi Mr. Khan."

HOLA! I had an idea for an OS a while ago and I've had this half completed for a few weeks, but I decided to finish and post it today. This doesn't exactly follow the timeline of the show, so Haya's nikaah hasn't happened yet but all the other events in their life have happened. 
glad that our zoya had a sweet friend like Nishaüò≥ her new game united Our asya Ô∏è They locked in store how romantic hainaüò≥ Asad n his ocd.. Wat a soft n gentle kiss ‚ò∫Ô∏è Then their confession ‚ò∫Ô∏è loved it to the core. Ô∏è Zoya need another 7 minutes ‚ò∫Ô∏è how sweet.. Magical asya made my day ‚ò∫Ô∏è and also their passionate kiss ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
Summary: Another Mangalpur inspired OS which starts from the point when Zoya is burried by the goons followed by Asad saving her and then ASYA realize their love for each other after spending a night in a small hut in which they took shelter.And yeah!! We finally see ASYA confesss their love for each other after returning back.
