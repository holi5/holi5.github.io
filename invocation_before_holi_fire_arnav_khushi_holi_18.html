        <h2><strong>invocation before holi fire happy holi image</strong></h2>
        <p>Holi bonfire on Holi eve in Delhi, 2012. Holika Dahan (Sanskrit: होलिका दहन, romanized: Holikā Dahana, lit. 'Burning of Holika'), rendered Holika Dahanam in Sanskrit or Chotti Holi, is a Hindu festival in which a bonfire is lit to celebrate the burning of the demoness, Holika [2] This ritual is symbolic of victory of good over evil. [3] 
If spared by the fire coconuts are also collected and eaten. Metaphorically though, the fire is meant to signify the destruction of evil - the burning of the 'Holika' - a mythological character and the triumph of good as symbolised by Prahlad. However, the heat from the fire also depicts that winter is behind and the hot summer days are ahead. 
The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan. The legend goes: The was once a young prince (he was a kid), the son of a tyrant king, who prayed to Rama (a deity in the Hinduism religion). The king thought himself to be a God and was furious that his son was worshipping another. 
The festival is a tribute to Prahalad and stands for good over evil. A day before Holi, also known as Choti Holi, Holika Dahan is done at an auspicious time. During Holika Dahan, the various Sanskrit mantras are chanted. It is considered that with this ritual, the holy heat of the fire clears all negative energies. 
On the day before Holi, also known as Chotti Holi, people light fire with dried leaves and branches. This bonfire commemorates the death of evil Holika. According to legend, the demon king Hirnakashyipu was fed up with his son Prahlad’s devotion for Lord Vishnu. 
A: Holika Dahan is celebrated on the night before Holi to commemorate the victory of Prahlad over Holika and the triumph of good over evil. Q: What are the rituals performed during Holika Dahan? A: The rituals include lighting the bonfire, offering prayers and worship to the gods, circling the fire three times, throwing grains and sweets into  
Holika Dahan, or burning of demon Holika, is an important event during Holi festival. On the night before Holi, people light fire with old things, sticks, branches and leaves. Holika Dahan 2025 date is March 13. It symbolizes the victory of good over evil. The bonfire can also be interpreted as a cleansing ceremony to assure in Holi festival. 
Prayers and Rituals: People walk around the fire, saying prayers. They ask for blessings and for bad things to be burned away, just like Holika was. Offering to the Fire: Some people throw coconuts, grains, or sweets into the fire as an offering. Singing and Dancing: There’s often music and dancing around the fire. People sing special Holi songs. 
Holika Dahan, also known as Choti Holi, is celebrated on the night before the main day of Holi. The name stems from a famous mythological tale of Prahlad and his evil aunt Holika. According to ancient Hindu scriptures, Holika was granted a boon by Lord Brahma that made her immune to fire. 
Holi, the festival of colors, is one of the most vibrant and joyous celebrations in India. It signifies the victory of good over evil and marks the arrival of spring. One of the essential rituals that precede Holi is Holika Dahan, a bonfire lit the night before the actual festival. 
Gracious Lord, sweep through this place with the winds of Your Spirit. Awaken our souls, ignite our passion, and let our praises rise like a relentless fire, unquenchable and vibrant, reaching towards the heavens. Mighty Savior, You who calmed the raging seas, calm the stirrings of our hearts that we may focus solely on You. 
Holi also celebrates the arrival of spring in India, the end of winter, and the blossoming of love. [15] [22] It is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season. [15] [22] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (full moon day) falling on the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. 
Invocation of the Holy Spirit. Dear Jesus, I come before You with an open heart, yearning for Your presence. Fill me with Your Holy Spirit, like a river overflowing its banks. Illuminate my mind with Your divine wisdom. Let Your truth be a beacon in my soul, guiding me through the darkness. Breathe life into my spirit, Lord. Just as the wind  
What I found interesting about the Holy Fire was the fact that you can feel and see how it starts manifesting even before it actually comes. I, for example, was seeing very small golden shining spheres float in the air, while the person next to me was seeing those as big silver feathers slowly floating and dissapearing. 
Holi is actually a two-day festival. Before the main Holi, there is Holika Dahan or Choti Holi (“small Holi”), where people gather around bonfires to sing and dance to let go of any negative  
The fire is also said to spontaneously ignite other lamps and candles around the church. The Holy Fire does not burn the hair, faces, etc. in the first minutes after it is ignited. Before entering the Lord’s Tomb, the patriarch is examined by Israeli authorities to prove that he does not carry technical means to light the fire. 
The person who experiences the miracle from close up by having the fire on the candle or seeing the blue light usually leaves Jerusalem changed, and for everyone having attended the ceremony, there is always a “before and after” the miracle of the Holy Fire in Jerusalem. How Old is the Wonder? 
Invocation Prayer to the Holy Spirit Come Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Your faithful and enkindle in them (in us) the fire of Your love. O Holy Spirit, beloved of my soul, I adore You. Enlighten me, guide me, strengthen me, and console me. Tell me what to do, direct my every choice.

The music is from the upcoming production of Rite of Mars planned for 2014, which you can help make a reality , with photos from the 2012 live production of  
The night before Holi, it’s popular for people to gather around bonfires to sing, dance, and let go of negativity from the previous year. All sorts of things are thrown into the flames  </p>
