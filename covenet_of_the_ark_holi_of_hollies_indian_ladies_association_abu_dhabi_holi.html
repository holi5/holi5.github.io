        <h2><strong>covenet of the ark holi of hollies vedic temple holi</strong></h2>
        <p>The Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies, (Kodesh haKedoshim), is the most sanctified place in the Mikdash. It housed the Ark of the Covenant and the Two Tablets of the law. Only the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) was permitted to enter here, and only on Yom Kippur. In the center of the Holy of Holies stood the foundation stone upon which the Ark rested. 
The Holy of Holies is the sacred space, and the Ark of the Covenant is its centerpiece, demonstrating that God’s presence (Holy of Holies) is accessed only through His covenant and mercy (Ark of the Covenant). Together, they prefigure the person and work of Christ, who fulfills the covenant, mediates the presence of God, and invites believers  
The room known as the Holy of Holies was the innermost and most sacred area of the ancient tabernacle of Moses and temple of Jerusalem. The Holy of Holies was constructed as a perfect cube. It contained only the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol of Israel’s special relationship with God. The Holy of Holies was accessible only to the Israelite  
The Holy of Holies was entered once a year by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, to sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals (a bull offered as atonement for the Priest and his household, and a goat offered as atonement for the people (this is where the term scapegoat originates from)) and offer incense upon the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy  
The Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, Aaron's rod that budded, and a golden jar of manna (Hebrews 9:3-4). The entrance to the Holy of Holies was separated from the Holy Place by a veil, a thick curtain that symbolized the separation between God and humanity due to sin. 
Within the Holy of Holies was placed the most sacred object: the Ark of the Covenant (description in Ex 25:10-22, Ex 37:1-9). The Ark of the Covenant contained (at least at one point) the two tablets upon which the Ten Commandments were written, a pot of Manna, and Aaron’s rod which had budded (Heb 9:4). 
The Holy of Holies was located at the west end of the Temple, and in Solomon’s Temple it enshrined the Ark of the Covenant, a symbol of Israel’s special relationship with God. At the entrance to the Holy of Holies stood a small cedar altar overlaid with gold. 
Hebrews 9:3-7 – The Holy of Holies in the context of the New Covenant: “Behind the second veil was a tabernacle which is called the Holiest of All, which had the golden censer and the Ark of the Covenant overlaid on all sides with gold, in which were the golden pot that had the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the  
The “Aron Haberit,”1 the holy ark of the covenant, is the most sacred artifact in all of Judaism. A golden box containing the tablets with the Ten Commandments, the ark stood in the Holy of Holies, the Temple ’s innermost sanctum. Today, its exact location is unknown, hidden until the day Moshiach comes.

Ark of the Covenant: A Copy of the Law Laid in the Side of. Ark of the Covenant: A Symbol of the Presence and Glory of God. Ark of the Covenant: A Type of Christ 
The Ark was housed in the Most Holy Place, or the Holy of Holies, within the Tabernacle and later in the Temple built by Solomon in Jerusalem. Only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies, and only once a year on the Day of Atonement, to sprinkle the blood of the sacrifice on the Mercy Seat for the atonement of the people's sins  
The Ark of the Covenant was placed in the Holy of Holies. The Ark contained the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments, Aaron’s staff, and a jar of manna—symbols of God’s covenant with the Israelites. 3. Access and Rituals: The High Priest was the only person allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, and only on Yom Kippur, the Day of

Exploring the Historical Context of the Ark and the Holy of Holies. The Ark of the Covenant and the Holy of Holies have their roots in ancient Israelite history and religious traditions. The Ark was first constructed during the time of Moses, as described in the biblical book of Exodus. 
Ark of the Covenant: Miracles Connected With: Manner of Its Restoration. Ark of the Covenant: Miracles Connected With: Philistines Plagued. Ark of the Covenant: Placed in the Holy of Holies.

Slide #3 — The Ark of the Covenant • In this room, pure gold shows God is holy, perfect, and without defect • Notice: the metal in the Tabernacle increased in worth the closer it was located to God's holy presence • "ark" means = "a box or a chest" • Size • length = 2 cubits and a half • breadth = a cubit and a half

Lesson: Read through Holy of Holies and the Ark of the Covenant (No. CB112) unless it is read as a sermonette with the children present. Questions and Answers . Q1. 
In the Tabernacle in the Wilderness we see that the Ark of the Covenant located in the Holy of Holies was also made of gold. God’s presence was in the Ark and it was also the receptacle of the Holy Spirit. As the High Priest symbolizes the living Temple that we are today, the gold represents the indwelling of God’s Holy Spirit in us. 
The Holy of Holies housed the Ark of the Covenant, which contained the two stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments had been inscribed by God, and the Ark remained in the Temple for approximately 400 years. When that temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C., the Ark of the Covenant was lost. 
The devir was closed off from the rest of the Temple by means of a heavy curtain. The word for this curtain is פרכת parokhet, which means a “barrier.”Interestingly, this word very closely resembles the name of the golden cover over the Ark of the Covenant, sometimes called the “mercy seat” because the golden cherubim sat upon it. </p>
