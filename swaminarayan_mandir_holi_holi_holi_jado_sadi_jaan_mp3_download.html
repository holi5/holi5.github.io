        <p>The offering of newly harvested grains is known as Holi. While there are several scriptural references that explain the significance of Holi, the story of Prahlad is the most popular. In the Swaminarayan Sampraday, devotees also celebrate the birth of Brahmaswarup Bhagatji Maharaj. 
Holi reminds us of the plight of Prahlad and the burning of his aunt Holika in the fire despite her boon. Moreover the religious significance of the festival of Holi is to mark the burning of self-conceit, selfishness, greed, lust, hatred, all the undesirable evil tendencies, propensities, thoughts and behaviours. 
Holi is one of the most colourful festivals in the Hindu calendar. It welcomes the onset of spring and celebrates the new life and vitality of all that follows. It also celebrates the triumph of good over evil and the saving grace of God, symbolised by the lighting of the Holi bonfire. 4.00pm to 4.15pm. 4.15pm to 6.00pm. Free car parking available. 
The religious significance associated with Holi reassures Devotees of the power of the truth and the ultimate victory of good over evil. It also enlightens us that the Lord always protects His Devotees that truly surrender unto Him.
