When mixed with thandai, bhang is known to be a relaxant, something to soothe the mind and body after a day of crazy colour-splashing. But what is bhang and what’s the  
Today, bhang is a staple at Holi and Maha Shivratri celebrations, where it is served most commonly with thandai — a cold beverage made from milk, sugar and an indulgent mix of nuts and species such as almonds, fennel seeds, watermelon kernels, rose petals, pepper, poppy seeds, cardamom and saffron.

Made with cannabis, milk, and a mix of spices, this drink has been enjoyed for centuries. Just be sure to serve it with care, as it’s not just refreshing but also can have a powerful effect. 
From "Bhang ka rang jama ho chaka chak" to "Zara si aur pila do Bhang", there are enough Bollywood scores dedicated to this Holi-special drink. Holi is not only the most colourful festival of our

Bhang is a drink made by drying and grinding the buds and leaves of the cannabis plant and is commonly consumed during Holi in India. Thandai, on the other hand, is a milk-based drink made with nuts and seeds . 
Does thandai contain bhang? No, Thandai does not contain bhang. Thandai is a refreshing, cooling drink made with nuts, seeds, and spices, making it healthy and safe for all age groups. Bhang, on the other hand, is a cannabis-infused drink that may be added to Thandai to make it intoxicating, especially during the festival of Holi. 
Holi is all about colours, sweets, thandai and bhang. Why bhang, which is made from the leaves and stem of the cannabis plant is legal, but ganja and hash, which are extracted from buds and seeds of the same cannabis plant, is illegal.
