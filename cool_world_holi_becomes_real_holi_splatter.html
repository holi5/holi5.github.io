Through means that are never adequately explained, Holli pulls Jack into the Cool World and seduces him, her goal being to become a Noid and be able to experience the pleasures real people enjoy. Having broken the Cool World's law, however, Jack and Holli start a chain of events that could result in the destruction of the world. 
Yet when Holli Would finally becomes a Noid (short for humanoid I presume, though like everything else in Cool World, the meaning is never actually explained) she and Deebs rather easily travel to the real world, while Harris must conjure up the memory of his earlier fate which magically teleports him back.
