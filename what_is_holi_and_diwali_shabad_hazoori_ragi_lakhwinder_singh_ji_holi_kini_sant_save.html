The first day of the celebrations is Holika Dahan, also known as Chhoti Holi or little Holi, and is when the religious rituals take place. The main event of Holika Dahan is a large bonfire where an effigy of Holika is burnt to symbolize the destruction of evil. 
In many places, a large bonfire is lit the night before Holi, called Holika Dahan or Choti Holi, to celebrate Vishnu’s protective power.
