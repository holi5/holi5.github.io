        <p>Anjali and Sarita didn't think too much of Arnav's hasty retreat and they excused themselves to go see Nani, not giving Khushi any chance to confront. Hoping they dropped the topic of taking Arohi with them, Khushi too went to check dinner preparations. 
When Khushi is 22, her parents died 13-14 years ago (when she was 8), and Arnav’s parents died 12-13 years ago (when he was 14). The only way that Garima can be single at the time of Arnav’s parent’s death is if the Tragedy happened in 1998 in the brief period were Khushi was 8 and Arnav 14: 
Anjali, on the other hand, was feeling exceptionally vulnerable. Filthy!Shyam had conditioned her to believe that Khushi was slowly stealing Arnav away, and this belief solidified when her Chhote believed Khushi - a woman he’d known barely a year - over Shyam - her husband of three years whom she worshipped as a deity - without any evidence.

Arnav on the other hand, unlike Khushi, didn't find surrogate parents. I don't think he found that surrogacy in Anjali, his sister. He couldn't replace his parents with either his grandmother or his dumb aunt or uncle. When he's mad, he's ASR and when he's nice, he's Arnav but really speaking it is the same guy. 
Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon also saw the Holi trend which is there in all the tv serials .. Well Garima and Madhumati come to the Raizada's to play Holi and they finally forgive Khushi on the auspicious occasion of Holi ..&amp;nbsp;

Khushi and Arnav helped Payal and Akash's wedding to become possible. She is in love with Arnav and cares for him deeply, and hasn't realized it yet. As Payal and Akash get married, a misunderstanding happens between Arnav, Khushi, and Shyam. Arnav thinks Khushi has feelings for Shyam. Arnav threatens to stop the marriage if Khushi does not

Anjali in my opinion is going to be in the dark about her husband's obsession. She is going to continue to believe her husband is the sweetest guy, Shyam will continue to keep up the facade but quietly torture Arnav and Khushi. The stress is going to be juggling the family life for Arnav , protecting Khushi from the crazy loon living under his  
Arnav walked down the stairs with nine months Anjali in his arms, yes! they have named Anjali's daughter with her mother's name, in this way her mother will always stay with her and between them. He looked around for Khushi, she must be somewhere with Ansh, handling two small babies really takes toll on her. 
ANJALI-ARNAV i dont think relation between a bro-sis had ever been so BEAUTIFULLY portrayed in indian tv histroey nd the way BARUN-DALJEET portrays it is jus awww feels like wishing that every1 shud get a bro like arnav and a sis like anjali and I JUS LUV IT how cvs hv shown the balance between the relation they dont jus shw arnavs concern for

This is a good point of discussion. I agree, there were several clear indicators that Arnav had fallen in love with Khushi before their marriage, one of the big signs being his realization after he thought Khushi had been in an accident, and then afterwards when he decides to tell her "Kyun farak padhta hai", before he witnessed her with Shyam on the terrace.
